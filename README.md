# pySTAR Toolbox
Python Symbolic regression Through Algebraic Representations (pySTAR) provides tools for generating mathematical (symbolic) models that best fit some input data. The pySTAR toolbox allows for the definition of the form of the surrogate model and the regression parameter values simultaneously.

# Getting Started

The pySTAR toolkit is installed as part of the IDAES Integrated Platform (IDAES-IP). Please see the README of the [IDAES-PSE repository](https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-pse) and/or the full [IDAES install instructions](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/getting_started/index.html) for details.
